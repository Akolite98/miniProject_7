This web page showcases an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation of a modal dialog. The modal is designed to open and close upon button clicks. The modal content and behavior are handled through a JavaScript class called Modal.

The page includes two event listeners:

The "OPEN MODAL" button has an event listener attached to the openBtn variable, which calls the open() method of the Modal instance when clicked.
The "Close Modal" button inside the modal has an event listener attached to the closeBtn variable, which calls the close() method of the Modal instance when clicked.
